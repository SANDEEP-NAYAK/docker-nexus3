You can read the readme file provided by the officials itself but this is how i did...

- I did not used any variables just direct impact

- Ibviously, Cloned the repo first

- Built the Dockerfile
`docker build -t nexus-repo-img .`

- Built a vol for persistent data prevail
`docker vol create nexus-vol`

- Ran an container out of it using the vol and port 8081 of the host as well as containe respectively.
`docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus -v nexus-vol:/nexus-vol nexus-repo-img`

- And remember chrome will take long to load this shit and hence I used Mozilla Firefox for that.

Amigo! My friend ... See you later
